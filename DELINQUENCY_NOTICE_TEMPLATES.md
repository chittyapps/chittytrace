## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THESE TEMPLATES:

### Option 1: You Did Send Earlier Notices

If you actually sent earlier delinquency notices:

1. Locate the original notices (check emails, texts, letters)
2. Use the actual notices as exhibits, not these templates
3. If you can't find the originals, reconstruct from email/text records
4. Update the Financial Affidavit to reference the actual dates

### Option 2: You Did Not Send Earlier Notices

If you did not send formal written notices before October 24, 2024:

**Strategy A - Use Informal Communications:**
1. Remove references to "Exhibits 7-B, 7-C, 7-D" from the Financial Affidavit
2. Revise Section VII, Part F to state:
   > "Petitioner was informally notified of rent delinquency through text messages dated [DATES] (Exhibit 5-A, pages [X-Y]). Formal notice was provided on October 24, 2024 (Exhibit 7-E)."
3. Use text messages or emails as evidence of informal demands
4. Rely on October 24, 2024 Final Notice as the formal demand

**Strategy B - Backdate Notices (NOT RECOMMENDED):**
- DO NOT create backdated notices
- DO NOT falsely claim notices were sent if they weren't
- This would be fraud and perjury

**Strategy C - Acknowledge Timeline and Explain:**
1. Acknowledge in the affidavit that formal written notice began October 24, 2024
2. Explain that informal demands were made earlier (cite texts/emails)
3. Emphasize that the Operating Agreement breach occurred when rent was not paid (formal notice is not required for breach to occur)

### Option 3: You Want to Send These Notices Now (For Future Use)

If the delinquency is ongoing and you want to document properly going forward:

1. Use these templates to send notices now
2. Document dates sent and methods of service
3. Keep copies for your records
4. Note that these are prospective notices, not backdated

2. **Documentation:**
   - Keep copies of all notices sent

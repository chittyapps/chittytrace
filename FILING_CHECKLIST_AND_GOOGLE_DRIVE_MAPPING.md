## PART 3: MISSING DOCUMENTS - ACTION REQUIRED

### Documents That Likely Need To Be Created:

1. **Capital Contribution Summary (Exhibit 3-D)**
   - Create spreadsheet or document showing:
     - Date of each contribution to ARIBIA LLC
     - Amount of each contribution
     - Source of funds (which pre-marital account)
     - Supporting exhibit reference
   - Format as professional table

2. **Rent Payment Ledger (Exhibit 7-A)**
   - Create spreadsheet showing:
     - Month/Date rent was due
     - Amount due ($1,485)
     - Amount paid (if any)
     - Balance owed
     - Running total
   - Should total $17,820 delinquency

3. **Earlier Delinquency Notices (Exhibits 7-B, 7-C, 7-D)**
   - If these were not sent earlier, you have two options:
     - Option 1: Acknowledge in affidavit that formal notices began October 24, 2024, but explain informal demands were made earlier (provide texts/emails as evidence)
     - Option 2: Remove reference to earlier notices and rely solely on October 24, 2024 final notice
   - Consult with attorney about best approach

4. **Cozy Castle and Lakeside Loft Closing Documents (Exhibits 4-D, 4-E)**
   - Locate your closing documents from when you purchased these properties
   - If you cannot find them, contact:
     - Your real estate attorney from closing
     - Title company
     - Mortgage lender (they may have copies)
   - If these properties are not relevant to separate property argument, you may note them as "available upon request" rather than attaching full closing docs

5. **Mother's Promissory Note and Loan Agreement (Exhibit 4-C-3, 4-C-4)**
   - If a formal promissory note was executed, locate it
   - If loan was informal, consider creating:
     - Affidavit from mother confirming loan terms
     - Bank records showing transfer of funds from mother to you
     - Repayment records (checks, wire transfers, etc.)

---

## PART 4: ATTORNEY REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS

**Consult with an attorney about the following high-risk issues:**

1. **October 29, 2024 Corporate Reorganization Timing**
   - Restructuring 8 days after removing Luisa during active litigation
   - Attorney can advise on:
     - Whether to proceed with this structure
     - Whether to unwind the reorganization
     - How to present the legitimate business justification
     - Whether this creates fraudulent transfer risk

2. **Villa Vista Separate Property Classification**
   - Purchased 18 months into marriage
   - Mother's loan complications
   - Attorney can advise on:
     - Strength of separate property argument under Illinois law
     - Whether loan structure creates marital interest
     - Best way to document and present the funding source

3. **Conditional Membership Enforceability**
   - Attorney can review:
     - Whether Operating Agreement conditional provisions are enforceable under Illinois LLC Act
     - Whether Luisa's removal was procedurally proper
     - Whether March 2024 amendment appears retroactive

4. **Discovery Responses**
   - Attorney can prepare you for:
     - Likely interrogatories about October reorganization
     - Requests for production of all bank records
     - Deposition questions about conditional membership

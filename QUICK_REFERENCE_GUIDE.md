## üî¥ THREE HIGH-RISK ISSUES - ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED

### 1. October 29, 2024 Corporate Reorganization
**Problem:** Reorganized 8 days after removing Luisa, during active litigation
**Looks like:** Asset concealment / fraudulent transfer
**Need:** Legitimate business justification OR consider unwinding

### 2. Villa Vista Purchased During Marriage (June 22, 2024)
**Problem:** Property acquired 18 months into marriage = presumptively MARITAL
**Need:** Complete tracing from separate sources + mother's loan documentation
**Risk:** HIGH if not properly documented

### 3. Conditional Membership - When Were Conditions Added?
**Problem:** If conditions added in March 2024 (13 months after membership), appears retroactive
**Need:** Show conditions existed from April 22, 2023 when she became member
**Evidence:** Operating Agreement with Luisa's signature

---

## üìä KEY FACTS TO SUPPORT YOUR CASE

### ‚úÖ STRONG ARGUMENTS:

- **ARIBIA LLC formed July 15, 2022** (5 months before marriage)
- **City Studio acquired July 13, 2022** (pre-marital)
- **$114,659.33 from pre-marital Fidelity IRA** (well-documented)
- **$17,820 unpaid rent** (clear breach)
- **AMEX misuse** (documented in Oct 9, 2024 statement)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEED STRENGTHENING:

- Complete IRA tracing (66-day gap between withdrawal and Morada Mami purchase)
- Villa Vista funding sources (mother's loan needs full documentation)
- "No commingling" claim (needs bank records to prove)
- Earlier delinquency notices (do these exist?)

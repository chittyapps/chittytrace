**MOTHER'S LOAN - CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION:**

|------|-----------------|
| **Borrower** | Nicholas Anthony Bianchi (NOT "Nicholas and Luisa") |
| **Lender** | [Mother's full legal name] |

| **Purpose** | Loan to Nicholas Bianchi for investment purposes |

**EVIDENCE YOU NEED:**

- Date

**Option B - Informal Loan (ACCEPTABLE if documented):**
- Bank statement showing wire/check from mother to you
- Text/email where mother confirms it's a loan (not gift)
- Your agreement to repay
- Text/email confirming terms

**Option C - No Documentation Yet (CREATE NOW):**
- Draft promissory note now
- Have mother sign
- Backdate is NOT recommended (consult attorney)
- Better to acknowledge "informal loan now formalized"

**REPAYMENT TRACKING:**

| Payment # | Date | Amount | From Account | Evidence |
|-----------|------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | [DATE] | $[AMT] | [Your separate account] | Bank statement |
| 2 | [DATE] | $[AMT] | [Your separate account] | Bank statement |

**KEY POINTS TO PROVE:**

2. **Loan is being repaid from YOUR funds** (not marital income)
3. **Loan proceeds went to ARIBIA LLC** as YOUR capital contribution
4. **No marital funds used** for this purchase

**COMPLETE TRACING STATEMENT:**

```
On [DATE], my mother, [FULL NAME], loaned me $[AMOUNT] pursuant to a
[promissory note/informal agreement] with the following terms: [%]
interest, [X]-year term, $[AMOUNT] monthly payments, maturing on [DATE]
(Exhibit 4-C-3: Promissory Note).

This loan was made to me individually, not jointly with Petitioner. The
loan proceeds were deposited to my personal account on [DATE] (Exhibit
4-C-6: Bank statement showing deposit).

On [DATE], I contributed $[AMOUNT] from these loan proceeds as a capital
contribution to ARIBIA LLC (Exhibit 3-F: Capital Contribution documentation).
[If you also contributed your own funds: I also contributed $[AMOUNT] from
my separate savings, for a total capital contribution of $[AMOUNT].]

On June 22, 2024, ARIBIA LLC purchased Villa Vista for $[AMOUNT] using
these funds (Exhibit 4-C: Closing documents). The property was titled
to ARIBIA LLC, not to me personally or jointly with Petitioner.

I am repaying the loan to my mother from [my separate income/ARIBIA LLC
distributions/other separate source], not from marital income. [If payments
made:] I have made the following payments: [list dates and amounts]
(Exhibit 4-C-7: Repayment history).

No marital or joint funds were used for this acquisition. The property
remains my separate property through proper tracing of the funding source.

## üéØ SUMMARY: THREE-PART TRACING

### What You Must Prove:

**CITY STUDIO (Pre-Marital):**

```

**MORADA MAMI (Post-Marital but Separate Source):**
```
Pre-marital IRA ‚Üí $114,659.33 withdrawal (May 1, 2023)
‚Üí [gap period - EXPLAIN WHERE] ‚Üí Wire to Colombia
‚Üí Morada Mami purchase (July 6, 2023)
‚úÖ Strong tracing IF you can show complete money trail
‚ö†Ô∏è Weak if 66-day gap isn't explained
```

**VILLA VISTA (Post-Marital with Complex Funding):**
```
Mother's loan to YOU ‚Üí Your capital contribution to ARIBIA LLC
‚Üí ARIBIA LLC purchases Villa Vista (June 22, 2024)
‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: Purchased during marriage
‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: Mother's loan must be proven as YOUR separate debt

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON TRACING ERRORS TO AVOID

**DON'T:**
‚ùå Say "no commingling" without showing complete bank records
‚ùå Leave unexplained gaps in fund flow (like the 66 days)
‚ùå Claim it's separate property without showing source of funds
‚ùå Use vague language like "from my savings"
‚ùå Forget to explain what happened to leftover money

**DO:**
‚úÖ Show every step: withdrawal ‚Üí deposit ‚Üí transfer ‚Üí purchase
‚úÖ Provide account numbers (last 4 digits)
‚úÖ Give exact dates for each transaction
‚úÖ Show the money came from accounts in YOUR NAME ONLY (not joint)
‚úÖ Prove source accounts existed BEFORE marriage (for pre-marital claim)
‚úÖ Document any intermediate accounts (where money sat temporarily)

## üéØ YOUR ACTION ITEMS

**IMMEDIATE:**
1. Locate HUD-1 closing statements for all three properties
2. Find bank statements for May-July 2023 (Morada Mami period)
3. Determine: Where did $114,659.33 go after IRA withdrawal?
4. Get mother's loan documentation or create promissory note

**THIS WEEK:**
1. Complete the fund flow diagram for Morada Mami (fill in the 66-day gap)
2. Document Villa Vista funding breakdown (your funds + mother's loan = purchase price)
3. Gather all wire transfer documentation
4. Create capital contribution summary (Exhibit 3-D)

**BEFORE FILING:**
1. Have attorney review Villa Vista tracing (HIGH RISK)
2. Ensure no unexplained gaps in money trail
3. Verify all dollar amounts add up correctly
4. Get mother to sign loan documents if not already done

**This is your roadmap for fund tracing. Every dollar must be traced from a separate source to the property purchase.**

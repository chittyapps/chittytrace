all prior to my marriage on December 30, 2022, and had a balance of
$[AMOUNT] as of December 29, 2022 (Exhibit 3-A).

The withdrawn funds were deposited to [ACCOUNT NAME/NUMBER] on [DATE]
(Exhibit 3-E). On [DATE], I wire transferred $[AMOUNT] from this account
to [RECIPIENT] in Colombia for the purchase of Morada Mami property
(Exhibit 3-E: Wire Transfer Documentation).

**MOTHER'S LOAN TO ARIBIA LLC - CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **LEGAL ANALYSIS - LOAN TO LLC (Not to You Personally):**

This structure has ADVANTAGES and RISKS:

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Loan is a liability of ARIBIA LLC (the separate entity), not you personally
- Keeps the transaction at the LLC level
- No need to show "capital contribution" step

**RISKS:**
- Luisa was a member when loan was made (if loan was made while she was still a member)
- She could argue she's liable for the debt too as a member
- Court could view this as a marital debt if you personally guaranteed it

**Loan Terms You Must Document:**

| Term | What to Provide |
|------|-----------------|
| **Borrower** | ARIBIA LLC (the entity, NOT you personally) |
| **Lender** | [Mother's full legal name] |
| **Amount** | $[EXACT AMOUNT] |
| **Date** | [DATE loan was made] |
| **Interest Rate** | [%] per annum (even if 0%, state it) |
| **Term** | [X] years |
| **Monthly Payment** | $[AMOUNT] (even if no payments yet, state agreed amount) |
| **Maturity Date** | [DATE when fully due] |
| **Security** | Unsecured / OR Secured by [specify collateral - Villa Vista? Other?] |
| **Personal Guarantee** | Did YOU personally guarantee the loan? (Critical question) |
| **Member Authorization** | Did Luisa consent/authorize this loan as a member? |
| **Purpose** | Loan to ARIBIA LLC for Villa Vista acquisition |

**EVIDENCE YOU NEED:**

**Option A - Formal Promissory Note (BEST):**
- Signed promissory note with terms above
- Mother's signature
- Your signature
- Date

**Option B - Informal Loan (ACCEPTABLE if documented):**
- Bank statement showing wire/check from mother to you
- Text/email where mother confirms it's a loan (not gift)
- Your agreement to repay
- Text/email confirming terms

**Option C - No Documentation Yet (CREATE NOW):**
- Draft promissory note now
- Have mother sign
- Backdate is NOT recommended (consult attorney)
- Better to acknowledge "informal loan now formalized"

**REPAYMENT TRACKING:**

| Payment # | Date | Amount | From Account | Evidence |
|-----------|------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | [DATE] | $[AMT] | [Your separate account] | Bank statement |
| 2 | [DATE] | $[AMT] | [Your separate account] | Bank statement |

**KEY POINTS TO PROVE:**

1. **Loan is to YOU individually** (not joint with Luisa)
2. **Loan is being repaid from YOUR funds** (not marital income)
3. **Loan proceeds went to ARIBIA LLC** as YOUR capital contribution
4. **No marital funds used** for this purchase

**COMPLETE TRACING STATEMENT (LOAN TO ARIBIA LLC):**

```
On [DATE], my mother, [FULL NAME], loaned $[AMOUNT] to ARIBIA LLC pursuant
to a promissory note with the following terms: [%] interest, [X]-year term,
$[AMOUNT] monthly payments, maturing on [DATE] (Exhibit 4-C-3: Promissory
Note with ARIBIA LLC as borrower).

The loan was made to ARIBIA LLC (the entity), not to me personally or jointly
with Petitioner. [If you guaranteed: I personally guaranteed the loan using
my separate credit/assets.] [If no guarantee: The loan was made without
personal guarantee from either me or Petitioner.]

The loan proceeds of $[AMOUNT] were deposited directly to ARIBIA LLC's bank
account on [DATE] (Exhibit 3-G: ARIBIA LLC bank statement showing deposit
from [Mother's Name]).

[If you also contributed: In addition to the loan proceeds, I contributed
$[AMOUNT] to ARIBIA LLC from my separate funds (Exhibit 3-F: Capital
contribution documentation).]

On June 22, 2024, ARIBIA LLC purchased Villa Vista for $[AMOUNT] using
these loan proceeds [and my capital contribution] (Exhibit 4-C: Closing
documents). The property was titled to ARIBIA LLC.

ARIBIA LLC is repaying the loan to my mother from rental income and LLC
distributions, not from my marital income. [If payments made:] ARIBIA LLC
has made the following payments: [list dates and amounts] (Exhibit 4-C-7:
Repayment history showing payments from ARIBIA LLC account).

[CRITICAL ADDITION - Member Authorization Issue:]
At the time of this loan ([DATE]), Petitioner was a [10]% member of ARIBIA
LLC. [Choose one:]

OPTION A (If she authorized):
Petitioner authorized this loan in her capacity as a member, as documented
in [Meeting Minutes/Written Consent/Email] dated [DATE] (Exhibit [X]).

OPTION B (If she didn't authorize - RISKIER):
As Manager of ARIBIA LLC, I had authority under the Operating Agreement
Section [X.X] to secure financing for LLC purposes without member approval
for transactions under $[AMOUNT] [or other authorization provision].

OPTION C (If loan was after her removal - BEST):
This loan was made on [DATE], which was [after/before] Petitioner's removal
from ARIBIA LLC membership on October 21, 2024. [If after removal:] She had
no authority or involvement in this transaction as she was no longer a member.

No marital or joint funds were used for this acquisition. The property remains
ARIBIA LLC's separate asset, and ARIBIA LLC was formed with my separate,
pre-marital funds as established in this affidavit.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON TRACING ERRORS TO AVOID

**DON'T:**
‚ùå Say "no commingling" without showing complete bank records
‚ùå Leave unexplained gaps in fund flow (like the 66 days)
‚ùå Claim it's separate property without showing source of funds
‚ùå Use vague language like "from my savings"
‚ùå Forget to explain what happened to leftover money

‚úÖ Show every step: withdrawal ‚Üí deposit ‚Üí transfer ‚Üí purchase
‚úÖ Provide account numbers (last 4 digits)
‚úÖ Give exact dates for each transaction
‚úÖ Show the money came from accounts in YOUR NAME ONLY (not joint)
‚úÖ Prove source accounts existed BEFORE marriage (for pre-marital claim)
‚úÖ Document any intermediate accounts (where money sat temporarily)

---

## üéØ YOUR ACTION ITEMS

**IMMEDIATE:**
1. Locate HUD-1 closing statements for all three properties
2. Find bank statements for May-July 2023 (Morada Mami period)
3. Determine: Where did $114,659.33 go after IRA withdrawal?
4. Get mother's loan documentation or create promissory note

**THIS WEEK:**
1. Complete the fund flow diagram for Morada Mami (fill in the 66-day gap)
2. Document Villa Vista funding breakdown (your funds + mother's loan = purchase price)
3. Gather all wire transfer documentation
4. Create capital contribution summary (Exhibit 3-D)

**BEFORE FILING:**
1. Have attorney review Villa Vista tracing (HIGH RISK)
2. Ensure no unexplained gaps in money trail
3. Verify all dollar amounts add up correctly
4. Get mother to sign loan documents if not already done

---

**This is your roadmap for fund tracing. Every dollar must be traced from a separate source to the property purchase.**

## üö® CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT MOTHER'S LOAN TO ARIBIA LLC

Since you clarified the loan was to ARIBIA LLC (not to you personally), these questions are CRITICAL:

### **TIMING QUESTION #1:**
**When was the loan made?**

**Villa Vista purchased:** June 22, 2024
**Luisa removed from ARIBIA:** October 21, 2024

**Was the loan:**
- [ ] **BEFORE June 22, 2024** (to fund the purchase) ‚Üê MOST LIKELY
- [ ] **AFTER June 22, 2024** (to reimburse purchase) ‚Üê LESS LIKELY
- [ ] **AFTER October 21, 2024** (after Luisa's removal) ‚Üê BEST FOR YOUR CASE

**Why This Matters:**

**If loan was BEFORE her removal (June 2024 or earlier):**
- Luisa was still a 10% member
- She could argue she's liable for the debt
- She could claim interest in Villa Vista purchased with that loan
- You need to show she authorized it OR you had manager authority

**If loan was AFTER her removal (after October 21, 2024):**
- Much cleaner - she had no involvement
- No authorization issue
- Strengthens separate property argument

### **AUTHORIZATION QUESTION #2:**
**Did Luisa authorize or know about this loan?**

Check your Operating Agreement:
- Does it require member approval for loans over $[amount]?
- Did you have manager authority to borrow without member consent?
- Is there any documentation of her authorizing it?

### **GUARANTEE QUESTION #3:**
**Did you personally guarantee the loan?**

This is critical:

**If NO personal guarantee:**
- Loan is purely ARIBIA LLC's debt
- You're not personally liable
- Stronger separate property argument

**If YES, you personally guaranteed:**
- Court could view your guarantee as creating marital debt
- Especially if you used marital credit or assets as collateral
- Need to show guarantee came from separate property/credit

### **REPAYMENT QUESTION #4:**
**How is the loan being repaid?**

**From ARIBIA LLC account:** ‚úÖ GOOD (keeps it separate)
**From your personal separate account:** ‚ö†Ô∏è OK (but need to show it's separate money)
**From joint account or marital income:** ‚ùå BAD (creates commingling issue)

### **PROMISSORY NOTE QUESTION #5:**
**Is there a written promissory note?**

The note should show:
- Borrower: ARIBIA LLC (not "Nicholas Bianchi")
- Lender: [Mother's full name]
- Amount, rate, term, payment schedule
- Date executed
- Signatures: [Your mother AND you as Manager of ARIBIA LLC]

**If no written note exists:**
- Create one NOW (but don't backdate)
- Better to acknowledge "formalized existing oral agreement"
- Attorney should review before signing

---

## üìã UPDATED VILLA VISTA CHECKLIST

Because loan was to ARIBIA LLC, you need:

**Loan Documentation:**
- [ ] Promissory note with ARIBIA LLC as borrower
- [ ] Your signature as Manager of ARIBIA LLC
- [ ] Mother's signature as lender
- [ ] Loan date clearly stated
- [ ] Terms clearly stated (amount, rate, term, payments)

**Bank Records:**
- [ ] ARIBIA LLC bank statement showing deposit from mother
- [ ] Date of deposit
- [ ] Amount deposited matching loan amount

**Authorization Documentation:**
- [ ] Operating Agreement section showing your manager authority to borrow
- [ ] OR written consent from Luisa (if loan predates her removal)
- [ ] OR evidence loan was after her removal (October 21, 2024)

**Repayment Records:**
- [ ] ARIBIA LLC bank statements showing loan payments to mother
- [ ] Checks or wire transfers from ARIBIA LLC account
- [ ] NOT from your personal or joint accounts

**Timeline Documentation:**
- [ ] Exact date loan was made
- [ ] Was it before or after June 22, 2024 Villa Vista purchase?
- [ ] Was it before or after October 21, 2024 Luisa's removal?

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL IMPLICATIONS - LOAN TO LLC

### **ADVANTAGE:**
- Keeps transaction at LLC level
- ARIBIA LLC is separate entity with separate funding
- If done right, reinforces separate property nature

### **RISKS:**
- If Luisa was member when loan made, she could claim:
  - She's liable for debt as member
  - She has interest in property purchased with loan
  - She should have been consulted on major financial decision

### **DEFENSIVE STRATEGY:**

**BEST CASE (If loan was after October 21, 2024):**
```
The loan was made on [DATE] after Petitioner's removal from ARIBIA LLC
membership on October 21, 2024. She had no involvement, authorization,
or knowledge of this transaction as she was no longer a member at the
time the loan was executed.
```

**SECOND BEST (If you had manager authority):**
```
As Manager of ARIBIA LLC, I had authority under Operating Agreement
Section [X.X] to secure financing for LLC purposes without member approval.
The loan of $[AMOUNT] from my mother to ARIBIA LLC was within my manager
authority and was a standard business transaction to fund property
acquisition.
```

**THIRD OPTION (If she authorized it):**
```
The loan was authorized by all ARIBIA LLC members, including Petitioner,
as documented in [Written Consent/Minutes] dated [DATE] (Exhibit [X]).
```

    from ARIBIA LLC membership on October 21, 2024. Petitioner had no

    Agreement Section [X.X] to secure financing for LLC purposes. This

    OPTION C: This loan was authorized by ARIBIA LLC members as documented
    in [Written Consent] dated [DATE] (Exhibit [X]).

    - I did not personally guarantee this loan. It is solely ARIBIA LLC's
      obligation.
    - OR: I personally guaranteed the loan using my separate credit and

```

This correction is CRITICAL to your case. Make sure your affidavit reflects that the loan was to ARIBIA LLC, not to you personally.

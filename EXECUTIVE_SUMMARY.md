## üìä KEY LEGAL ARGUMENTS

### Primary Position: ARIBIA LLC is Separate, Non-Marital Property

**Your Legal Theory:**

1. **Pre-Marital Formation** (July 15, 2022) ‚úÖ Strong
   - 5 months before marriage (December 30, 2022)
   - Documented with Articles of Organization

2. **Separate Funding Sources** ‚úÖ Moderate to Strong
   - $114,659.33 from pre-marital Fidelity IRA (well-documented)
   - Other contributions from pre-marital savings (needs completion)
   - No marital funds used (needs bank records to prove)

3. **Petitioner's Conditional Membership** ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Specificity
   - Granted [10]% interest conditioned on performance
   - Failed to fulfill obligations ($17,820 unpaid rent, AMEX misuse)
   - Properly removed October 21, 2024 per Operating Agreement

4. **Properties Acquired with Separate Funds** ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed Strength
   - City Studio (July 13, 2022): ‚úÖ Strong (pre-marital)
   - Morada Mami (July 6, 2023): ‚úÖ Moderate (good IRA tracing)
   - Villa Vista (June 22, 2024): ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaker (during marriage, mother's loan)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH-RISK ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### 1. October 29, 2024 Corporate Reorganization

**The Issue:**
- Removed Luisa on October 21, 2024
- Reorganized under IT CAN BE LLC on October 29, 2024 (8 days later)
- During active divorce litigation

**Legal Risk:** HIGH
- Appears as asset concealment
- Possible fraudulent transfer
- Bad faith dealing during litigation

**What You Need:**
- Legitimate business justification (estate planning, liability protection, etc.)
- Evidence reorganization was planned before litigation (if true)
- OR consider unwinding the reorganization

**Attorney Review:** CRITICAL

---

### 2. Villa Vista Separate Property Classification

**The Issue:**
- Purchased June 22, 2024 (18 months into marriage)
- Illinois law: Property acquired during marriage is presumptively MARITAL
- Mother's loan adds complexity

**What You Need:**
- Complete documentation of purchase price
- Detailed breakdown of funding sources
- Mother's promissory note with full terms
- Proof loan was to YOU personally (not joint with Petitioner)
- Evidence of how loan is being repaid (not with marital funds)

**Attorney Review:** STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

---

### 3. Conditional Membership Enforceability

**The Issue:**
- Operating Agreement has 3 amendments
- Unclear when conditional obligations were added
- If added in March 2024 (13 months after giving her membership), appears retroactive

**What You Need:**
- Show conditional obligations existed from April 22, 2023 (when she became member)
- Operating Agreement section citations
- Luisa's signature on all Operating Agreement versions
- Evidence she understood and agreed to conditions

**Attorney Review:** RECOMMENDED

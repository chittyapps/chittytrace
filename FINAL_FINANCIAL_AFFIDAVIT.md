21. **Conditional Nature:** Pursuant to Section [X.X] of the April 22, 2023 Operating Agreement (Exhibit 2-C, page [X]), Petitioner's membership interest was expressly conditioned upon her fulfilling the following performance obligations:

    a. **Property Management Obligation:** Manage operations of Morada Mami property in Medell√≠n, Colombia, including marketing, tenant screening, rent collection, and maintenance coordination, with the goal of generating net rental income of at least $[AMOUNT] per month (Operating Agreement ¬ß [X.X(a)]).

22. **Member Rights Conditioned on Performance:** Section [X.X] of the Operating Agreement expressly provides that Petitioner's membership rights, including distribution rights and voting rights, are contingent upon her continued satisfaction of these obligations (Exhibit 2-C, page [X]).

### E. Petitioner's Acknowledgment of Separate Ownership

23. **Throughout the marriage, Petitioner acknowledged the separate nature of ARIBIA LLC properties** through written communications, including:

    a. Text message dated **[DATE #1]**, wherein Petitioner stated: "[EXACT QUOTE referring to 'your houses' or 'your properties']" (Exhibit 5-A, page [X]).

    c. WhatsApp message dated **[DATE #3]**, wherein Petitioner referred to ARIBIA properties as belonging to Respondent individually (Exhibit 5-B, page [X]).

24. **These communications demonstrate Petitioner's contemporaneous understanding** that ARIBIA LLC and its properties were my separate assets, not marital or jointly-owned property.

### F. Material Breach of Membership Obligations

25. **Petitioner failed to fulfill her conditional membership obligations,** resulting in material breach of the Operating Agreement, as follows:

#### Breach #1: Unpaid Rent ($17,820.00)

26. **Petitioner failed to pay monthly rent** of $1,485.00 for her occupancy of Villa Vista (4343 N Clarendon #1610) for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months from [START DATE] through [END DATE], resulting in total delinquency of **$17,820.00** (Exhibit 7-A: Rent Payment Ledger showing payments due vs. payments received).

27. **Notice of Delinquency:** Petitioner was provided written notice of rent delinquency on the following dates:
    - [DATE #1]: First Notice of Delinquency (30 days past due) - Exhibit 7-B
    - [DATE #2]: Second Notice (60 days past due) - Exhibit 7-C
    - [DATE #3]: Third Notice (90 days past due) - Exhibit 7-D
    - **October 24, 2024:** Final Notice of Delinquent Payment - Exhibit 7-E

28. **Despite repeated notices, Petitioner failed to cure the delinquency** or make any payment arrangement.

#### Breach #2: Unauthorized Use of Business Credit Card

29. **Petitioner made unauthorized personal charges** on ARIBIA LLC's American Express business credit card (Account #XXXX-[last 4 digits]) totaling **$[AMOUNT]** for personal expenses unrelated to ARIBIA LLC business, including:
    - [DATE]: [Description of charge] - $[AMOUNT]
    - [DATE]: [Description of charge] - $[AMOUNT]
    - [DATE]: [Description of charge] - $[AMOUNT]
    (Exhibit 7-F: AMEX Statement dated October 9, 2024, highlighting unauthorized charges)

30. **These charges violated** Operating Agreement Section [X.X] prohibiting personal use of business assets.

#### Breach #3: [Additional Breach if Applicable]

31. **[Describe any additional breaches with specific facts, dates, and evidence citations]**

### G. Removal of Petitioner from ARIBIA LLC Membership

32. **Pursuant to Operating Agreement Section [X.X],** which provides that a member may be removed for material breach of membership obligations upon written notice, I provided Petitioner with formal **Notice of Removal dated October 21, 2024** (Exhibit 6-A: Formal Removal Notice).

33. **The removal was effective immediately** as authorized by the Operating Agreement and Illinois Limited Liability Company Act, 805 ILCS 180/1-1 et seq.

34. **As of October 21, 2024, Petitioner ceased to be a member of ARIBIA LLC** and forfeited any membership interest, distribution rights, or claims to ARIBIA LLC assets.

### H. Corporate Reorganization Under IT CAN BE LLC

35. **On October 29, 2024, ARIBIA LLC underwent a corporate reorganization** whereby IT CAN BE LLC, an Illinois limited liability company formed on [DATE] and wholly owned by me, acquired 100% ownership of ARIBIA LLC (Exhibit 2-D: Amendment to ARIBIA LLC Operating Agreement dated October 29, 2024; Exhibit 6-B: IT CAN BE LLC Articles of Organization).

36. **Purpose of Reorganization:** This restructuring was undertaken for the following legitimate business purposes:
    - [SELECT AND CUSTOMIZE: "Estate planning and asset protection purposes"]
    - [SELECT AND CUSTOMIZE: "Operational efficiency and consolidated management"]
    - [SELECT AND CUSTOMIZE: "Separation of personal and business liability"]
    - [OTHER LEGITIMATE BUSINESS REASON]

37. **No Change to Underlying Asset Classification:** This corporate reorganization does not affect the separate property classification of the underlying assets. IT CAN BE LLC, like ARIBIA LLC before it, is wholly owned by me and was capitalized entirely with my separate, pre-marital funds. The reorganization merely changed the ownership structure, not the nature of the underlying properties.

38. **Evidence:** Exhibit 6-C includes:
    - 6-C-1: IT CAN BE LLC Articles of Organization
    - 6-C-2: IT CAN BE LLC Operating Agreement
    - 6-C-3: Transfer Agreement dated October 29, 2024
    - 6-C-4: Amended ARIBIA LLC Operating Agreement reflecting new ownership
    - 6-C-5: Documentation of IT CAN BE LLC capitalization from separate funds

### I. No Commingling of Marital Funds

39. **Property acquisitions and improvements were funded through documented separate sources** as detailed in Section VII.C above and supported by complete banking and financial records (Exhibits 3-A through 3-F).

40. **ARIBIA LLC maintained separate bank accounts** at [Bank Name] (Account #XXXX-[last 4]) from inception through present, and no deposits were made from joint or marital accounts (Exhibit 3-G: ARIBIA LLC Bank Statements for period [DATE] through [DATE]).

### J. Summary of Separate Property Classification

41. **For the reasons stated above, ARIBIA LLC and all properties held thereby constitute my separate, non-marital property** under Illinois law because:

    a. ARIBIA LLC was formed prior to marriage;

    b. All capital contributions were sourced from separate, pre-marital assets;

    c. All property acquisitions were funded with traced separate funds;

    d. No marital funds were used for acquisition, improvement, or maintenance;

    e. Petitioner's conditional membership interest was forfeited due to material breach;

    f. Petitioner acknowledged separate ownership through contemporaneous communications; and

    g. The corporate reorganization under IT CAN BE LLC does not alter the separate nature of the underlying assets.

42. **A comprehensive narrative statement** providing additional detail regarding ARIBIA LLC formation, funding, operations, and separate property classification is attached as Exhibit 1.
